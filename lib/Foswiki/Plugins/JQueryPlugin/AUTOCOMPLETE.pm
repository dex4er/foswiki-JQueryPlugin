Autocomplete an input field to enable users quickly finding and selecting some
value, leveraging searching and filtering.  
By giving an autocompleted field focus or entering something into it, the
plugin starts searching for matching entries and displays a list of values to
choose from. By entering more characters, the user can filter down the list to
better matches.  
This can be used to enter previous selected values, eg. for tags, to complete
an address, eg. enter a city name and get the zip code, or maybe enter email
addresses from an addressbook.
